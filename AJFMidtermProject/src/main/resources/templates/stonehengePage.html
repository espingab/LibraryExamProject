		<p>
			Stonehenge is perhaps the worldâ€™s most famous prehistoric monument. 
			It was built in several stages: the first monument was an early henge monument, 
			built about 5,000 years ago, and the unique stone circle was erected in the late 
			Neolithic period about 2500 BC. In the early Bronze Age many burial mounds were 
			built nearby.
